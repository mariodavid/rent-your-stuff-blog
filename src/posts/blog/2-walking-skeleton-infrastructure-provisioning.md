Continuing on the walking skeleton of our application, we now shift towards the infrastructure. 
In particular, we will use Heroku to host our application. Furthermore, we will remote-control Heroku
via Terraform, which is an Infrastructure as Code tool that allows to declaratively define infrastructure
resources via source code.

This video will takle the following points:

* provision infrastructure via Terraform
* explain the Terraform workflow with Terraform Cloud
* provision Heroku application via Terraform
* provision Heroku database via Terraform
