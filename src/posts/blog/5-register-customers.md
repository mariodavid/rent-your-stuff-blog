This video now finally starts with implementing some Jmix functionality: creating / registering customers. In particular, it covers:

* create the first entity: Customer with the help of Jmix Studio
* explaining the database delta detection via Liquibase changelogs
* create a mapped superclass for the standard attributes
* explain the concept of "instance name" in Jmix
* generate first CRUD screens for the Customer entity
* use an embedded Address entity in the customer for storing the address information
* explain how to add new attributes to already generated screen
