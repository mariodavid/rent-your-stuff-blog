In this issue we will refactor the UI test interactions a little more, to make it easier to create the next UI test cases. 

We will cover:

* describing the new `TableInteractions` and `ScreenInteractions` class
* show how to use them in test cases
* create a new `ProductBrowse` test case with new APIs
