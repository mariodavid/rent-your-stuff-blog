In this issue we will create the first part of a walking skeleton (https://wiki.c2.com/?WalkingSkeleton) which is to:

* have GitHub Issue template in place
* CI pipeline using GitHub Actions
* automated tests succeed in the pipeline
* introduce to the workflow of small issues and GitHub pull requests
